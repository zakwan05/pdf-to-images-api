âœ… **System Dependencies**: pdf-poppler installs poppler-utils automatically  
âœ… **Server Processing**: All PDF conversion happens on the server  
âœ… **Image Response**: Returns base64 encoded PNG images  
âœ… **No Client Processing**: Your Android app just receives images!

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "PDF converted to 3 images",
  "images": [
    {
      "filename": "page-1.png",
